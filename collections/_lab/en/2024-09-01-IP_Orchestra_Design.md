### What?
The "Interplanetary Players Orchestra" is a musical co-creation workshop that seeks to blend diferent artistic and scientific disciplines into a creative and transdisciplinary space. Over three days, participants will work together to co-create a meaningful experience using meta-instruments and the power of their imagination. The Interplanetary Players combine characteristics of traditional and contemporary instruments into a digital interface accessible from multiple devices. The experience will culminate in an exhibition showcasing the results of this collaborative process.

### Why?
The workshop arises from the need to explore new forms of interaction and co-creation that transcend traditional barriers between artistic and scientific disciplines. By inviting people from different fields to participate, the goal is to create a space where individual ideas and experiences intertwine to generate meaningful connections. The central idea is that the relationship between human beings is not only vertical or horizontal but orbital, and this approach can generate new forms of collective expression and understanding through music and sound.

### For what purpose?
The primary objective is to foster the creation of an inclusive and experimental sound ensemble where no prior musical experience is required, allowing participants to explore the infinite possibilities of music and sound in a collaborative environment. Additionally, the workshop aims to integrate artists, students, and the present audience into a holistic art experience, using advanced technology to synchronize musical creation with human movement and cosmic patterns, such as those of the Kepler-47 star system planets.

### How?
The workshop will take place at the Universidad de las Artes in Guayaquil, as part of the Escuela de Artes Sonoras and the Minga Multimedia de Arte y Tecnolog√≠a (MMAT) 2024, over three days of practical and theoretical sessions, culminating in a presentation concert. Participants will start by familiarizing themselves with and experimenting with meta-instruments, working in a research and creation process that integrates disciplines such as music, theater, dance, cinema, programming, and more. Each day will be structured with a combination of presentations, discussions, and practical sessions, culminating in the co-creation of a sound piece. The third day will feature an exhibition presenting the final result, integrating all the perspectives and disciplines explored during the workshop.
