card_description: For some species, the clouds hold a special significance. They are not just a visual spectacle, but also a physical sensation. To feel the tension in the clouds is to connect with the energy of the sky, to sense the electricity and potential of a coming storm. It is a reminder that the natural world is not just something to be observed, but something to be experienced. To touch the clouds is to connect with the raw power of the sky, to feel the force that shapes the land and the weather. It is to recognize that the natural world is not just something to be appreciated, but also something to be revered, for it holds the power to shape our world and our lives.
