card_description: The aquifer in the south is estimated to be approximately 34,000 km¹¹. This underground water source is crucial for the survival of many species and ecosystems in the region. Aquifers provide a reliable source of water for irrigation, drinking, and industrial use. They also play a key role in maintaining the structural integrity of the land, by preventing soil erosion and maintaining water tables. The preservation of aquifers is essential for the long-term sustainability of the planet, as it ensures the availability of clean water for future generations. The study and management of aquifers is a complex and multidisciplinary task that requires a deep understanding of hydrogeology, geology, and environmental science. The importance of protecting and preserving these vital resources cannot be overstated.
