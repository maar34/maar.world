card_description: There exist species with the extraordinary ability to perceive the future. They perceive beyond the present, into the ethereal realm of what is yet to come. They listen to the whispers of time, the faint echoes of tomorrow, and understand all is interconnected. They know their actions, thoughts and emotions shape the future, and use this knowledge to guide their paths. They dance with the winds of change, sing to the stars of tomorrow, and understand that the future is not set in stone, but in the hands of those who can hear its song. They are the guardians of tomorrow, keepers of the unknown, using their gift to weave the tapestry of the future with care and intention. They are the seers of the unknown, masters of time, holding the key to shaping the future.
