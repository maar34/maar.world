card_description: In the midst of a thriving city surrounded by nature, a healthy soundscape is essential in preventing polarization and fostering a sense of unity and community. The power of sound and its ability to shape the way we perceive and interact with our surroundings is acknowledged. Living in harmony with the natural soundscapes is a way of life and music is created that reflects the beauty and diversity of the surroundings. Sound is understood to be capable of bringing people together and fostering a sense of community. At the same time, it is also acknowledged that sound can be used to divide and create conflict. Efforts are made to create a healthy soundscape, one that is diverse, inclusive, and respectful of different perspectives. By preserving a healthy soundscape, a more harmonious and united community is created, one that is less prone to polarization and division.
