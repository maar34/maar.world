card_description: The voice of fire is heard in the world, it speaks in the tongues of volcanoes and whispers in the embers of campfires. Fire is a force of nature, both destructive and transformative. The people of Maar have always been fascinated by the voice of fire, and they have woven it into their myths and legends. Fire is a reminder of the power of the earth and its ability to create and destroy. It is a source of warmth and light, but also a source of danger, capable of burning down forests and devastating communities. The voice of fire reminds us of its importance and the need to respect and harness its power. It is a reminder that, like all-natural elements, the fire must be respected and understood, in order to be able to live in harmony with it.
