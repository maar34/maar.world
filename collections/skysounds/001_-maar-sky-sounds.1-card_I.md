card_description: The north of Maar World is a place where the ground and water sing in harmony, yet it is also a place where the wildness of nature can be both beautiful and terrifying. The cliffs echo with the roar of the sea, and the forests rustle with the gentle flow of streams, creating a symphony of sound that is both serene and fierce. The inhabitants of the north have always listened to the songs of their land and they have woven them into their music, entangled flutes sing like the wind creating a melody that reflects the soundscapes of their surroundings. They have learned to appreciate the beauty and power of nature, yet also respect its potential dangers. The water and ground of the north have shaped their culture and society, teaching them to live in harmony with the elements and to respect their power. The soundscapes of the north are a reminder that we are all connected to the land and that there is always more to discover in the beauty and mystery of the multiverse.
