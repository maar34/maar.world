card_description: Electricity is not just a source of power, but a manifestation of the energy of the suns. It fuels all living things, from the tiniest microbe to the largest tree, and it is the force that drives the natural world. The energy of the suns is not just a physical phenomenon, but also a spiritual one. It is the force that animates all living things, and it is the source of inspiration for music and dance. This energy, known as prana, flows through all living things, sustaining them and giving them life. The inhabitants of this world understand that by tapping into this energy, they can not only light their homes and power their machines, but also nourish their souls and inspire their creativity.
