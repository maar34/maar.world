card_description: The caves of the islands offer a glimpse into the past, with hidden treasures like ancient artifacts and fossils waiting to be discovered within their walls. These caves are not just geological marvels, but also gateways to the heart of the earth, where the boundary between outside and inside dissolves. Venturing into the caves means entering the darkness, not only physically but also mentally. Yet this darkness is essential, reminding us of the importance of silence. In the depths of the earth, one can hear the secrets of the land, the flow of water and the echoes of long-extinct creatures. Silence is not just an absence of sound, but a presence of profound understanding. By embracing the darkness and the silence, one can connect with the natural world in a way that transcends the limitations of daylight.
