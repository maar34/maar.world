<h3>  Hybrid ( Live+DJ) sets </h3>


From thirty minutes to four hours experiences in the format of sonic or audiovisual journeys around concepts like the classical elements, or expeditions to different solar systems, exoplanets, and stars.

Each concept is represented under different musical moods ranging from ambient, and downtempo to house, and techno, always adapting to the note of the moment. The soundscapes and voices are elements that bring a singular narrative to each experience. For more than a decade, Bruna has been assembling a unique archive of soundscapes, poetry, testimonies, native South American chants, radio signals, and a selection of eclectic music to create experiences that connect people and cultures through sound.
