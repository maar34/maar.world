# About 

Marco Colasso Soca, aka Maar, is a sound artist who works on transdisciplinary creations at the intersection of art, science and technology. After studying Sound Design and Engineering in Montevideo and Santiago de Chile, Maar has collaborated with the sound and interaction design on many large-scale installations in America and Europe, such as the Uruguay Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale 2021 and 2018 and the Uruguay and Chilean Pavilion at the Milan Expo 2015, also cooperating in the development of <a href="http://headbrothers.com" rel="Head Brothers Home Page" target="_blank">Head Brothers</a>, <a href="http://headbrothers.com/exoplanetas" rel="Exoplanetas Page" target="_blank">Exoplanetas</a> and Aventures Sonores. Throughout eleven years, Maar has been creating stories that connect people and cultures, creating an archive of soundscapes, poetry, testimonies, native South American chants, radio signals, and a selection of eclectic music that serve as material for the evolution of a unique sound adventure.

>In those moments, I connected with the idea of starting to create generative Soundscapes from outer space, sonifying agents travelling through fractals and imaginary worlds. What do other planets sound like?

>Travel, play, enter the landscape and in this movement to rethink the connections that as beings we had and have with the environment we inhabit. A dialogue of feelings that finds a place in improvisation with soundscapes, spoken voice, music and the present moment.

>The Suns, the Moons, the mountains, the hills, the stones, the caves, the clouds, the rain, the seas, the rivers, the lagoons, the flora and the fauna are also part of Maar ritual soundscapes.

> "Sound, unlike architecture, is invisible, and if it can be integrated into it while maintaining this invisibility, it can come to represent not only its voice, but also its spirit, becoming a transparent extension of it". Luis Barrie

> Then the whole body will become an ear and all sounds will come to you, the known and the unknown, the sweet, the sad and the urgent. When my body lies in bed white and blue at night, all sounds come to me from their own chord, unhurried, strangely mixed, the slightly tonal and the soft creaks of the mountains. At that moment, to hear is to be on high alert... and I hear songs in front of me... when I go beyond "to the country that loves silence".
