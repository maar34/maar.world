WelcomE to my new old 𝛚Ⓞ尺♩ᵈ. Slow down to enter a place where gravity is 2.93 slower than earth.
Last measurments found an archaic substratum beyond rationality, in the pure expression of creation that is an uncontainable cosmic instinct, a microscopic dance with musical harmonics. The moment in time when this circumbinary planet shines most brightly is when Dionysus meets Apollo, in the forests or in the cities, inside and outside the established order, wild, free, a communion of dragons, big cats and dancing childrens. 🐉 🦁 👼🏽
